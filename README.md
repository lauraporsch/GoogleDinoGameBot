# GoogleDinoGameBot
Bot based on pyautogui module, automating the Google Dino Game.
As the code is based on the screen size of my laptop, it will not work for everyone.
I tried to find a way how to automate it, independently from screen size, however I couldn't find a way that works reliably.

If you have an idea or a hint for me, it would be greatly appreciated.

# What I learned / used for the first time:
- using the pyautogui module
- using a screenshot to find the position of an image on the screen
